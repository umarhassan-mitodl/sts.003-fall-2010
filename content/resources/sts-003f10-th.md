  caption: This 1968 photo by Apollo 8 crewmember Bill Anders shows the Earth seemingly
    rising above the lunar surface. Note that this phenomenon is only visible from
    someone in orbit around the Moon. Because of the Moon's synchronous rotation about
    the Earth (i.e., the same side of the Moon is always facing the Earth), earthrise
    is not witnessed by a stationary observer on the surface of the Moon. (Public
    domain photo from NASA.)

description: This 1968 photo by Apollo 8 crewmember Bill Anders shows the Earth seemingly
  rising above the lunar surface. Note that this phenomenon is only visible from someone
  in orbit around the Moon. Because of the Moon's synchronous rotation about the Earth
  (i.e., the same side of the Moon is always facing the Earth), earthrise is not witnessed
  by a stationary observer on the surface of the Moon. (Public domain photo from NASA.)

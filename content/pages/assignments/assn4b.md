_Body Worlds: The Anatomical Exhibition of Real Human Bodies_ is an exhibition of "plastinated" human bodies, composed by the German anatomist Gunther von Hagens. Hagens creates his specimens using a technique he invented in 1977 for turning human body parts into plastic. Many of you may have seen _Body Worlds_ in one of its many incarnations. If you have not seen it "in the flesh," you have probably seen the newspaper ads, billboards or placement as scenery in James Bond movies. Since it first opened in 1995 in Tokyo, between twenty-five and thirty million people have attended _Body Worlds: The Anatomical Exhibition of Real Human Bodies_. The exhibition traveled to England in 2002, where it first encountered major criticisms on scientific, ethical, and aesthetic grounds. It has since traveled all over Europe, Asia, and North America, along with the advertising billboards with catchy slogans. For documentation see [www.bodyworlds.com](https://bodyworlds.com/).

The Boston Museum of Science, for example, hosted _Body Worlds: The Anatomical Exhibition of Real Human Bodies_ from 2006 to 2007, and the city was ablaze with ads the whole time. In the show, "real" human specimens, including whole-body plastinates, individual organs, organ configurations, and transparent body slices are arranged in gigantic exhibition halls; at the exit, visitors are requested to donate their bodies, _post-mortem_, to the project. In Boston, as throughout the world, the show met with huge successes and also huge controversies. Is this science or spectacle? Is this pedagogically useful or morally suspect?

This assignment asks you to develop an argument that situates _Body Worlds_, and the legal, ethical, and scientific controversies surrounding it, in historical context. In developing your argument, consider the histories of the scientific disciplines of anatomy and physiology, and of material practices – such as vivisection and dissection – that have long constituted part of both scientific research and scientific education. Finally, consider the historical context of science, culture, and spectacle – as in the case of the public dissections of 16th-century Padua, the incredible popularity of Vesalius' volume, and the controversy over grave-robbing. These are only suggestions for relevant examples from history—feel free to pick your own historical examples as you see fit.

Sources pertaining to the contemporary context include primary sources by Gunther von Hagens, early reviewers of the exhibit, and the official Body Worlds Web site. Secondary sources include articles by ethicists and historians of science. Sources pertaining to the historical context include primary sources by Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey, as well as secondary sources by historians of biology and medicine. You should include a mixture of types of sources in your research and this range of sources should be reflected in the citations you include in your final paper. Note: Your paper **must** include at least two primary sources and at least four secondary sources.

You are strongly encouraged to work with your Teaching Assistant while preparing your final project. Naturally if you have additional questions you may also consult with Professors Jones and Kaiser.

In the written portion of this assignment, you should use standard footnote conventions, giving full bibliographic information for all sources from which you draw, and include a bibliography at the end. Examples of appropriate footnote and bibliography formats appear in the handout "Footnotes, Bibliographies, and the Good Life" referenced for previous papers. You should also consult our "Guidelines for Writing Papers" both for tips on how to organize your essay and for information regarding proper use of web-based sources. _Failure to use appropriate footnote and bibliography formatting will lower your grade_. If you have any questions about how to cite your sources, please check with any of the instructors.
